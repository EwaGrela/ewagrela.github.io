# CodersLab programming course final project
## Website about the 90s

The site can be seen here: https://ewagrela.github.io/project90/
1. The menu directs to each section of the site
2. The play button directs you straight ot the most interesting section, the games section
3. Series of questions and answers about the project
4. Series of short articles about the interesting 90s phenomena - I wrote them myself, as the site is a personal homage to this joyous decade
5. Game section: in Memory Game you memorize the pictures and you have precisely 10 seconds to do so. Then you  have 60 seconds to uncover all of them and score points. Otherwise, you will score no points.
6. Game section: in Trivia Quiz you can choose which level of difficulty you prefer and check your knowledge on 90s bands and celebrities. Time is limited and all questions must be answered.
7. Game section: a series of three Personality Quizes to choose from. 
8. Footer directs to my other projects which are equally fun.
9. The site runs on mobile devices and is responsive due to flexbox layout so feel free to play some games while sitting commuting to work.


##User experience tips:
For the best user experience I recommend using Chrome or Firefox browsers ( same for mobile devices). The site also runs on IE 11, because it supports flexbox layout model.
