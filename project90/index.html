            <h1>Q and A</h1>
            <h2>*(You need to press the buttons)</h2>
            <button>Why did you make this website?</button>
            <p>
              I belong to a group some people call the 90s kids. I remember things like the millenium bug, the opening of the first McDonald's in Warsaw, as well as the time internet was a luxury. I wanted to share my memories.
            </p>
            <button>What were your favourite things about the 90s?</button>
            <p>
              Hard to answer, really! I think my favourite thing was the fashion. Could not wear the cool stuff though, I was to young. Some of it is making a comeback, I might give it a try now!
            </p>
            <button>Did you have a favourite band?</button>
            <p>
              Ok, now you can all start to laugh, but I was really into boybands. My favourite one was the Backstreet Boys and I did have a crush on Nick. However, later on I started to like Justin Timberlake way more. 
            </p>
            <button>Was there any movie you liked?</button>
            <p>
              Yes, in fact there were quite a few. The ones that really got stuck in my mind were "Philadelphia" -cried a lot when I first saw it and it really shaped my worldview- and "Fight Club". The other ones are "American History X" and "Primal Fear" -geez, the latter was scary. All in all, this might mean I really like Edward Norton. I do.
            </p>
            <button>Was there anything you did NOT like?</button>
            <p>
             Several things, I guess. I will tell you about just one. I remember the time Michael Jackson visited Poland. Even as a kid I found it a bit <em><big>absurd</em></big> and a bit <em>insulting</em> that a popstar was invited to see the <em><strong>president</em></strong> and ministers.
