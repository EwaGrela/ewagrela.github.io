			<h2>The Treaty of Randomness</h2>
			<article>
				<p>
					In the year 2167, a strange thing took place. Machines and humans, until then coexisting peacefully, started a war. After the humans darkened the Sun to deprive machines from their main source of energy, both sides suffered heavy losses. The Dark Days came, along with hunger and death. The United Earth Nations and O1 decided the matter should be solved in a polite manner by playing the ancient game of Paper Rock Scissors, as proposed by both the <strong>UEN Prime Minister <em>Penny Coin</em> and 01 Minister of War <em>R0b As1mo</em></strong>. Thus The <big><em>Treaty of Randomness</big></em> was signed by the President of the UEN Adam Friedman and the President of 01 Andy Roid. Every year each side would pick one entity in tribute. The contestants would then go to The Uncanny Valley and battle for <strong>10 rounds</strong>. They would repeat the process unless the result was established. The victor would receive an award and the winning side would take turn in ruling what was left of the planet Earth for the upcoming year.
