      <h1> Date Night</h1>
        <article>
          <p>
            Meet Johny. Johny is a lovable fella. He is living the American Dream - has a condo, a car, a good job and a loving fiancee he refers to as "my future wife".<br>
            Together they go on dates where they drink scotchka, eat pizza and do other stuff.<br>
            Weren't it for his enemies - <strong><big>Chris-R and Claudette</strong></big> - his life would be perfect.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is a <em><big>date night</em></big> tonight, but unless Johny completes three tasks, he will get no sweet lovin'.<br> He must <em><big>pick the spoons</em></big> from the floor of his apartment, then <em><big> get a promotion</em></big> and later <em><big>buy a dozen red roses</em></big>.
