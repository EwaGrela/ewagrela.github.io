            Meet Johny. Johny is a lovable fella. He is living the American Dream - has a condo, a car, a good job and a loving fiancee he refers to as "my future wife".
            Together they go on dates where they drink scotchka, eat pizza and do other stuff.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is a date night tonight, but unless Johny completes three tasks, he will get no sweet lovin'. He must <em>pick all the spoons from the floor of his apartment</em>, then <em> go to work and get a promotion</em> and later <em>buy a dozen red roses</em>.
